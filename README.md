# HSC - Hydrogen infrastructure analysis tool for Python
This tool was used for the creation of the publication ["Seasonal storage and alternative carriers: A flexible hydrogen supply chain model"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.050) published in Applied Energy

HSC offers the functionality to calculate predefined hydrogen supply chain architectures.

## Installation and application

First, download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Then, clone a local copy of this repository to your computer with git

	git clone https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/HSCPathways.git
	
or download it directly. Move to the folder

	cd HSCPathways

and install the required Python environment via

	conda env create -f environment.yml 

Last, run following [*Jupyter Notebook*](Workflow - Seasonal Storage and alternative carriers - A flexible hydrogen supply chain model.ipynb) to reproduce the results.

We are the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-3">Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3)</a> belonging to the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
